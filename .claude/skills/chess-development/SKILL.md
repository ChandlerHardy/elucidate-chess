# Chess Development Skill

**Purpose:** Expert guidance for chess application development with AI integration, engine analysis, and modern web technologies.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building chess applications or features
- Integrating chess engines (Stockfish, etc.)
- Implementing chess logic and rules
- Working with PGN/FEN notation
- Adding AI-powered chess analysis
- Chess UI/UX development
- Chess data modeling and storage

## Key Topics Covered

### Core Chess Development
- **Chess engines**: Stockfish integration, UCI protocol
- **Chess notation**: PGN parsing, FEN handling, move validation
- **Chess rules**: Legal move generation, checkmate detection, game states
- **Chess data**: Game storage, position analysis, opening books

### Technology Stack Specifics
- **Frontend**: React chessboards, move visualization, game state management
- **Backend**: Chess logic APIs, engine communication, game persistence
- **AI Integration**: Position analysis, move recommendations, explanations
- **Database**: Chess game storage, position indexes, user progress tracking

### Chess Application Patterns
- **Game analysis workflows**: Multi-engine analysis, variation trees
- **Learning systems**: Progress tracking, spaced repetition, concept detection
- **Performance optimization**: Fast move generation, efficient position storage
- **User experience**: Intuitive chess interfaces, smooth animations
